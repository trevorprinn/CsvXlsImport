CsvXlsImport
============

This library contains classes that import data from a CSV file or Excel workbook into a collection of model objects, or directly into an Entity Framework database. It uses reflection to work decide how to copy the data into the target objects. There is also a WinForms form that can be displayed to the user to allow them to choose where the data gets copied to.

It contains some simple unit tests, and a simple test of the field selection form as examples.
